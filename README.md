# RISC-V Single Cycle CPU

This is an in-class lab assignment for my Computer Architecture and Assembly Language course at the IBA-Karachi.

### Q1 Display Name and ID saved in Data Memory on TTY

0. Make sure [java](https://www.java.com/en/) is installed.

1. Run `logisim-evolution.jar` using Java.

2. Open `q1 32b_single_cycle_cpu_single_page.circ` in `logisim-evolution`.

3. Load `IMEM` and `DMEM` to the corresponding memory modules in `logisim-evolution`. 

4. Enable simulation at 1hz tick frequency.

### Q2 Convert XOR, OR and AND gates in the ALU to NAND
